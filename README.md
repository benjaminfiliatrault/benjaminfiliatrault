# Benjamin Filiatrault

## Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Benjamin Filiatrault, a passionate Software Engineer with a strong background in backend development and extensive experience in working with cloud infrastructure. I'm driven by a desire to leverage technology to create innovative solutions and make a positive impact on the world. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, and explorations in the field of software engineering.

## About Me

I hold a Computer Science degree and have been working as a Software Engineer for more than 6 years. During this time, I've gained valuable experience in developing robust and scalable solutions. I have a deep understanding of various technologies and frameworks, and I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

## Projects

Here are some of the notable projects I've worked on:

- **[Neural Network in Rust](https://github.com/benjaminfiliatrault/neural_network):** I was searching for a nice Rust project to do so I decided to start a personal Neural Network framework why not, playing with Matrixes, improving memory allocation, and creating a Xor Gate. Let's where it goes...
- **[Advent_of_Code](https://github.com/benjaminfiliatrault/adventofcode):** Just a repo with some Advent of Code problems solved using Rust
- **[SpaceTraders](https://github.com/benjaminfiliatrault/spacetraders):** A somewhat worker, to play SpaceTraders API multiplayer game where we need to manage ships, resources, and complete contracts.
- **[word_combinations](https://github.com/benjaminfiliatrault/word_combinations):** A challenge from one of my colleagues where using the English dictionary we can find a given amount of non-repeating character from a given length. The question was if in the English dictionary there is 5 words that have non-repeating character.

Feel free to explore these projects in more detail by visiting the respective repositories or live demos.
